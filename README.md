# fourphase_cube_solver
A c++ console app that solves Rubik's cube under 30 moves

The status of Rubik's cube are generated by six face rotations. 
This method divides the status of the cube into four phases, 
where rotations 
{F, F2, B, B2, R, R2, L, L2, U, U2, D, D2}, 
{F2, B2, R, R2, L, L2, U, U2, D, D2}, 
{F2, B2, R2, L2, U, U2, D, D2}, 
{F2, B2, R2, L2, U2, D2} 
are allowed respectively.
